          I am a Full Stack Web Developer based out of Las Vegas, NV. I have
          used languages like JavaScript to create numerous web applications as
          well as frameworks like React. I also have used Nodejs to create a
          handful of fullstack applications.

          In 2018 I joined a 4 person team to help maintain software that helped
          businesses with inventory management. My role was to create new
          features for existing clients at their request. I mainly worked in
          Javascript, MySql and some Php.

          In 2017 I attended a 3 month coding boot camp at General Assembly. I
          studied Javascript and frameworks like Angular and React. I also built
          many web apps using those framworks along with Node.js, Mongo
          Databases and Firebase. Since graduating I have kept busy improving my
          skills and learning new ones. I plan on continuing my education by
          learning php and python in the near future

        <p>
          Spinnr is a mobile app built using React Native. The app allows a user
          to take a photo of a record cover and have it automatically play in
          Spotify. We have put the app on hold but plan to market our product
          soon before we launch our Kickstarter.
